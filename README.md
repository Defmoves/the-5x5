## Development Platform

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
A open source superset of JavaScript which provides value typing.

[Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) 
A framework for server-rendered React apps, which astracts away the need for configuring developer centric necesities such as babel and webpack.

Created by the developers at ziet, a hosting company with a generous (free as in beer) developer tier. Affording for simple and costless hosting of sideprojects.

[Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) 
A react library predicated on Google's materiel design system. Bundled with all manner of components, a flexable grid system and a intuitive CSS-in-JS implementation. 

[nextjs-with-typescript](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/nextjs-with-typescript)
Taken from the material-ui source, this example provides a working implementation of the above three technologies, and so a preconfigured development platform. The dual page example code was removed in order to provide a blank slate to start work.
